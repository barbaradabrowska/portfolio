# About me
Passionate for working in the spirit of **Agile methodology and Certified ISTQB tester (Foundation Level)**. I want to build high-quality products, that customer will use with pleasure. Experience in managing my own website, online shop and ilewazy.pl helped me understand the importance of testing and prepared me to be a **detailed tester. Finding and fixing issues** gives me irreplaceable reward and a sense of progress. There is nothing better than solving challenging problems with a great team.

Personally I am a **good listener**, reflection is my second name. I appreciate honest relationships and valuable discussions.
